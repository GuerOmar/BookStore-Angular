## BookStore

This project is a simple Angular application built to demonstrate my proficiency with Angular, including components, services, routing, and state management. It showcases best practices for structuring an Angular project and handling API requests. This project highlights my ability to develop clean, maintainable, and efficient Angular applications.  

The application represents a bookstore where users can browse and find books. It also includes an admin feature that allows administrators to add authors and books to the store.  

## How to Test the Application  

To simulate a backend server, I added the `json-server` dependency. To test the application locally, run the following commands:  

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the frontend application:  

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

3. In another terminal, start the mock backend server:

   ```sh
   npm run server
   ```

Once both are running, open `http://localhost:4200` in your browser to explore the bookstore and its features.
